VALUES ('Kathy is the “One”, the only “One” you should consider caring for your pet. She looked after our senior dog for 10 days while we travelled abroad and not once did I worry about him. She would send daily updates with photos and tell you a little bit about the day they spent together... unfortunately our dog had a few evening accidents that we didn''t hear about until we came home. So, she dealt with the not so nice aspect or dog sitting. Kathy has a beautiful disposition and think animals pick up on her energy immediately. Would highly recommend her to anyone looking for the best dog sitter around!', 'Luis & Barbara'),
('We have two large particular dogs! Our pups are used to our home and we feel best when they can stay in our house and we feel completely stressed when they board somewhere else.  Our largest one has a fear of other dogs and needs patience and his personal bubble protected. Kathy took our dogs temperaments on with ease. She went the mile to walk our fearful one in the early mornings and later evenings so he wouldn''t have to deal with other dogs and he could enjoy his sniff time; whilst separately taking our social poodle on hikes to meet other furry friends. I already have three more reservations with her before summers end, and I can''t wait for the R&R knowing she will send loving pics of my fur babies while I am sipping wine at the vineyard. Kathy keeping the house safe is just a bonus.', 'Will & Sabrina'),
('I find one of the most difficult things to do is leave my dog behind when I go on vacation. This year, Kathy Samuel looked after my 13-year-old Labrador while I went to Hawaii. Upon my return, I questioned if my dog even noticed I had left! Kathy looked after his every need including specific medication requirements, long slow walks, cuddles on the coach and periodic conversations. Kathy is more than a dog sitter. She genuinely cares about your pet and will ensure that she is their best friend while you are away.', 'Dave & Kerri');
